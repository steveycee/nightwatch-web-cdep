# Nightwatch.js Web CDEP: Basic Branch

## Quick start

- Clone this repo
- Open your tools of choice (I use VS code and its built in terminal)
- Go to your console/terminal and type `npm i`
- Still in the console type `npm t`
- A test _should_ run against ao.com (guess where I work right now?)

## Who this is for

This is a super simplified basic ready to run version of NigtwatchJS with no bells or whistles using the page object pattern.
