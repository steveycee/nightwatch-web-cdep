# Nightwatch.js Web CDEP: Basic Branch

## Quick start

- Clone this repo
- Open your tools of choice (I use VS code and its built in terminal)
- Go to your console/terminal and type `npm i`
- Still in the console type `npm t`
- A test _should_ run against ao.com (guess where I work right now?)

## Who this is for

This is a super simplified basic ready to run version of NigtwatchJS with no bells or whistles using the page object pattern.

If there's something interesting in here though its also for you. I'll try my best to do clear write ups of what I do, how I do it and why. Naturally if you've got any feedback please drop me a message on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/steveycee)** üê¶
