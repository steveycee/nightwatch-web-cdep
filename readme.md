# Nightwatch.js CDEP

## Work in progress

### Aiming to do the following:

- Include working example and guide for integration with BrowserStack
- Include working example and guide for integration with Visual Diff/UI testing tool \*tbc
- Include working example and guide for integration into common build pipelines

### Why:

The aim of this project is to put together an example of automated testing step in a continuous deployment pipeline that encompasses what I believe are key needs when delivering a Web front end to an end user and that is it tested cross platform while still providing fast feedback for development teams.
